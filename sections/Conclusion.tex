\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we have proposed a novel deep recurrent autoencoder for depth completion. Our architecture builds on the work of Murdock \etal on Deep Component Analysis and further establishes the link between sparse coding and deep learning. We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods for depth completion, including those that leverage RGB information. We also show that the success of our method is fundamentally a product of the internal optimization it performs, and that due to its small number of parameters it is able to perform well even without a large training set.\\

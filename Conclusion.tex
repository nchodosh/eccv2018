\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we have proposed a novel deep recurrent autoencoder for depth completion. Our architecture builds on the work of Murdock \etal on Deep Component Analysis and further establishes the link between sparse coding and deep learning. We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods for depth completion, including those that leverage RGB information.
